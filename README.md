# Connect4-3d
A 3d Connect 4 game written in Python using Panda3D


Using Epihaius' primitive maker at (https://github.com/Epihaius/procedural_panda3d_model_primitives) 

You can play against different AI levels, it's a minimax alpha-beta algorithm.


Still to be improved, because for the AI max level, it takes a while to calculate the "best" move (it's still Python :D) and it does that between 2 frames, so the game freezes for a bit before the AI plays. I tried to integrate threads or processes, but these are kinda complicated in Panda3D and I haven't dived into it yet :)
